# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Here’s the styled version for your `README.md` file with proper Markdown formatting:

# 📋 To-Do List Application

This is a simple and user-friendly **To-Do List Application** built using **React** and **Vite**, with styling done using **Tailwind CSS**. The application provides essential functionalities for managing daily tasks, including adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.

- 🗑️ **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.  
- ✅ **Mark Completed**: Mark tasks as completed, with a ✅ tick mark displayed before the task description.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is organized in the `src` folder, where all JSX components are maintained in a separate folder:

- **`Header.jsx`**: Contains the input field and the button to add new tasks.  
- **`To-Do-List.jsx`**: Renders the list of tasks.  
- **`To-Do-Item.jsx`**: Displays individual task items with buttons to edit, delete, or mark as complete.  

The main styling is located in the `./src/App.css` file.
